# Programme to find the Prime Or Composite number in the given range

    print(num, "is a neither prime NOR composite number")
else:

# Range(11,15)
#Then the status of each number in the range is :
#11 is prime
#12 is composite not prime
#13 is prime
#14 is composite
#15 is composite
#Count : 2 prime and 3 composite numbers in the range
